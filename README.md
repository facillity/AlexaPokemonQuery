# AlexaPokemonQuery
Unofficial pokedex for Amazon's Alexa. Created to give Alexa users the ability to access things like a Pokemon's type and national ID in just a few short seconds. Users also have the ability to ask Alexa about type matchings and see which Pokemon types are strong against what other pokemon types.
Made by Ignacio Amezcua for the purpose of experimenting with Alexa, Amazon Webservices, and Amazon's developer site.
